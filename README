 Guile TAP — A Test Framework that emits TAP output
----------------------------------------------------

This is a library for GNU Guile that implements a framework for specifying test
cases that emit output that adheres to the Test Anything Protocol (TAP)¹.

It comes with an experimental harness (tap-harness).

If you're using emacs, here are a number of adjustments to the default indenta-
tion behaviour so it knows some of the macros the library uses:

(mapc (lambda (thing)
        (put (car thing)
             'scheme-indent-function
             (cdr thing)))
      '((for-each-test . 1)
        (with-test-bundle . 1)
        (with-fs-test-bundle . 1)
        (with-ellipsis . 1)
        (set-record-type-printer! . 1)
        (define-test . 1)))
