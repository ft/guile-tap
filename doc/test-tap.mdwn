# DESCRIPTION

*scm-test-tap* is a framework for writing test suites in Scheme, that emit
output compliant with the TAP protocol. It features a fairly rich API for
conveniently writing large, yet maintainable test suites.

Currently, the code makes use of a number of non-standard features from GNU
Guile. No other scheme implementation is actively supported at this point.


# TERMINOLOGY

TODO


# ANATOMY OF A TEST SCRIPT

Test scripts contain bundles of actual tests. Such bundles are defined by
‘*with-test-bundle*’:

~~~~~~~{.scheme}
(with-test-bundle (hierarchy symbols here)
  ...)
~~~~~~~

A bundle has a planned number of tests, that it contains. This is articulated
by the ‘*plan*’ procedure (if there is no plan yet, the ‘*no-plan*’ procedure
can be used instead):

~~~~~~~{.scheme}
(with-test-bundle (hierarchy symbols here)
  (plan 12)   ; optionally: (no-plan)
  ...)
~~~~~~~

The actual tests are defined by calls to ‘*define-test*’, that connects a test
expression to a test title. The test expression is one variant of a
‘*pass-if-*\*’ macro, that takes care of all the book-keeping involved with the
processing of the test suite itself. Thus a very simple script could look like
the following snippet (the *(test tap)* module imports the framework's code):

~~~~~~~{.scheme}
(use-modules (test tap))

(with-test-bundle (math simple)
  (plan 1)
  (define-test "Basic integer addition works"
    (pass-if-= (+ 1 2) 3)))
~~~~~~~

This is the basic structure of test-scripts. The framework contains some helper
functionality to deal with common situations found in the real world. The
EXAMPLE section shows the use of some of those. The ‘*test/*’ subdirectory of
the project's source code directory contains a number of tests that make sure
the framework behaves as expected. Those scripts may be used for instructional
purposes as well.


# TEST DIRECTIVES

Test directives add additional information to tests. Currently, they can be
used to skip tests or mark them as `TODO`, which means that the test should be
run but be expected to likely fail, possibly because the part of the software
that is being tested is not finished yet.


## Skipping Tests

Some tests may be known to fail. Such tests can be skipped entirely by telling
the framework to do so. There are two ways to skip tests: *Static* skips will
skip the tests in question without question. *Dynamic* skips allow the user to
supply a predicate, that when evaluated determines whether the tests it covers
should be skipped or not.

# TEST CASE MACROS

The macros discussed in this section need to be used to perform the actual
testing with test-suites using this framework, since they take care of all the
required book-keeping as well as generating the desired TAP output.

The most generic of all these macros is ‘*pass-if-true*’ and all other macros
could indeed be implemented in terms of it. For example:

~~~~~~~{.scheme}
;; Here's an example we've already seen:
(define-test "Basic integer addition works"
  (pass-if-= (+ 1 2) 3))

;; And this is really the same test:
(define-test "Basic integer addition works"
  (pass-if-true (= (+ 1 2) 3)))
~~~~~~~

The additional macros are provided to increase brevity and clarity.


## Generic Tests

These are the most basic of test macros, that can be used to check for complex
properties, that the more specialised macros cannot. These macros take exactly
one argument, that is tested for the value indicated by the macro's name.

* `(pass-if-true EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-false EXPRESSION)`


## Equality Tests

The macros listed in this section provide specialised tests for Scheme's
generic equality predicates (*eq?*, *eqv?* and *equal?*). Each predicate has a
positive and an inverted logic macro version. Each of these macros take exactly
two arguments upon which the test indicated by the macro's name is performed.

* `(pass-if-eq? EXPRESSION EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-not-eq? EXPRESSION EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-eqv? EXPRESSION EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-not-eqv? EXPRESSION EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-equal? EXPRESSION EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-not-equal? EXPRESSION EXPRESSION)`


## Value specific tests

The macros listed in this section provide specialised tests for some of
Scheme's value types (namely strings and numeric values). Each predicate has a
positive and an inverted logic macro version. Each of these macros take exactly
two arguments upon which the test indicated by the macro's name is performed.

These macros test for equality of numeric values:

* `(pass-if-= NUMBER NUMBER)`
* `(pass-if-not-= NUMBER NUMBER)`

* `(pass-if-~= NUMBER NUMBER EPS)`
* `(pass-if-not-~= NUMBER NUMBER EPS)`

The latter two incantations implement approximate equality testing, by allowing
the user to provide a measure of the approximation via the *EPS* parameter.

These perform a test for absolute equality of two given strings:

* `(pass-if-string=? STRING STRING)`
* `(pass-if-not-string=? STRING STRING)`

The following two macros perform a test for case-insensitive equality of two
given strings:

* `(pass-if-string-ci=? STRING STRING)`
* `(pass-if-not-string-ci=? STRING STRING)`

Finally, these macros perform the test of matching a string to a regular
expression. They assume the first argument to be a string containing the
regular expression to be matched against the string in the second argument.

* `(pass-if-re-match PATTERN STRING)`
* `(pass-if-not-re-match PATTERN STRING)`


## Exception Handling Tests

The set of macros listed in this section can be used test if a given expression
causes an exception to be thrown or not. The first two macros listed expect
exactly one argument: The expression to be evaluated. The third macro expects
two arguments: First the type of exception that is expected to be thrown and
second the expression to be evaluated.

* `(pass-if-any-exception EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-no-exception EXPRESSION)`
* `(pass-if-exception SYMBOL EXPRESSION)`


## Custom Tests

The framework provides a macro ‘*define-tap-test*’ that can be used to define
custum test macros. Macros defined in this way exhibit all features, that the
core macros described above offer, because those are indeed defined in terms of
‘*define-tap-test*’ as well.

* `(define-tap-test TEMPLATE EXPRESSION)`


# Utilities

# Other API

## The Plan

With TAP the output of a test script announces the number of tests that are
expected to run. This serves as a safeguard against test scripts that may die
unexpectedly. Since the number of tests a script runs is usually deterministic,
this requirement can be easily fulfilled. With scripts that run a
non-deterministic number of tests, it is possible to to produce a plan-like
line as the last line of a scripts output that shows the number of tests that
were run.


### Deterministic plans

The ‘*plan*’ procedure produces a plan line. It requires one integer value as
its sole argument and produces TAP compliant output.

* `(plan INTEGER)`

This should be among the first steps in every test bundle (usually it is indeed
the first action taken), before any tests are performed.


### Non-deterministic plans

In case the number of tests in a script is not known, the ‘*no-plan*’ procedure
may be called. It takes no arguments and causes a bundle to produce a plan-like
line at the end of its output. This procedure should be called in the same
place the ‘*plan*’ procedure would normally be used.

* `(no-plan)`


## Bundles

Bundles may be used to group a number of tests into a logical group. The
*with-test-bundle* macro introduces such bundles.

* `(with-test-bundle HIERARCHY expression(s) ...)`

It is possible to have more than one bundle per file, however the default
‘*prove*’ TAP harness from the Perl programming language expects only one plan
per test script, which mean that it cannot be used without modification if you
plan to use multiple bundles in a script.

The framework provides a wrapper for ‘*with-test-bundle*’ that deduces the
hierarchy argument by looking that the test-scripts name in the file system.

* `(with-fs-test-bundle expression(s) ...)`

See the “Configuration” section below for details about how to control how the
file name of the test-script is turned into a hierarchy list.

# EXAMPLES

## Test complex properties with generic macros

~~~~~~~{.scheme}
(define-test "The *foo* variable has valid type"
  (pass-if-true (or (boolean? *foo*)
                    (integer? *foo*))))
~~~~~~~

## Perform a regular expression test

~~~~~~~{.scheme}
(define-test "test: re-match"
  (pass-if-re-match "^Does.*match" "Does this match?"))
~~~~~~~

## Define and use a custom test macro

If tests for string-ness of a value a needed often:

~~~~~~~{.scheme}
(define-tap-test (pass-if-string? datum)
  (string? datum))

(define foo "bar")

(with-test-bundle (demo custom-tests)
  (define-test "Check if foo is a string"
    (pass-if-string? foo)))
~~~~~~~
